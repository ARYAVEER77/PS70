# PS70 – Introduction to Digital Fabrication (Harvard University)

This repository documents my work for **PS70: Introduction to Digital Fabrication**, a project-based engineering course offered through Harvard University. The repository contains weekly assignments, experiments, and a final project completed over the duration of the course.

## Course Context
PS70 focuses on hands-on engineering, physical computing, digital fabrication, and iterative design. The emphasis of the course is not only on building functional systems, but also on documenting process, failures, and improvements clearly and transparently.

## Repository Structure
Each folder corresponds to a specific week of the course:
- `week1` – `week12`: Weekly assignments, prototypes, code, and documentation  
- `FINAL`: Final project documentation and implementation  
- `.html / .css files`: Course website pages used for documenting work and reflections  

All documentation is written incrementally as the course progressed.

## What I Worked On
Across the course, I:
- Designed and fabricated physical systems using digital fabrication tools
- Integrated hardware and software components
- Built and iterated on prototypes under real constraints
- Documented failures, debugging steps, and design decisions
- Developed a final project that synthesizes multiple course concepts

The work reflects learning through experimentation rather than polished end results.

## Authorship
All work in this repository represents my **independent coursework** completed as part of PS70. Feedback was received through standard course instruction and peer discussion, but all design, fabrication, coding, and documentation were done by me.

## Final Project
The final project integrates concepts from digital fabrication, physical computing, and system design explored throughout the course. Documentation and implementation details are available in the `FINAL` folder and associated project pages.

## Reflection
PS70 strengthened my ability to translate abstract ideas into physical systems, iterate through failure, and communicate engineering work clearly. The course emphasized that effective engineering depends as much on documentation and user context as it does on technical execution.

                <h3>Part 1:CNC </h3>
                 
                 <p>
                    This week we were tasked with creating an object using CNC Milling  
                   <br>  
                    For this weeks assignment I teamed with felow class mates Mehemet and Case .We decided to CNC the blue mountains from Jamaica .I had been to Jamaica last year and was mesmerized by the beauty of it .I twas case who brought up the idea to do so.So we settled on the idea of doing the topography of the bue mountains.
                    <br> <img src="./t1.jpg" alt="p1" width="300" height="400">
                    <br> Here is the process:
                    First of we began to modell it on fusion which took us a solid hour or two to complete.Although we picked from another source it was the sizing part on which we had to work most since our orignal output seemed to be a metre long .We used a boit of Bobbys help and a Cases skill's to shrink to an achievable size .
                    <br>Here is where we faced our first problem as such .The que to use the CNC although not ong was vey time consuming it took one group over an hour to mill their  piece out.Whereas we accomplished ours in a few minutes .
                    <br>At first when we began we measured the thickness of the word made sure all the machine units were in place and got started out .I was skeptica about the design since we could not see anything that the CNC was doing due to the large amounts of sawdust as visible here.                
                   <br> <img src="./t3.jpg" alt="p1" width="300" height="400">
                   The sawdust was eaasy to remove after we were done using the vaccum .The mountiains turned out exactly how I wanted them to be.Although the cut was a bit to curved that is complex with diffrent ayers .As visible in the images it did do quite well We were pleased with what we had done .
                   <br> <img src="./t4.jpg" alt="p1" width="300" height="400">
                   <br>Here is another image displaying the same.
                   The model clearly depicts what we aimed to do it has diffrent layer showcasing and highlighting what we aimed to achieve with our project .
                   <br>Tips:
                   <br>1.Make sure to sandpaper to scrape off the excessive dust or residue on your modle it seemed to be very tiring thanks to the work of me and case we did it soon enough.
                   <br>2.Dont be in a hurry to remove your object since you may risk breaking it .
                  <br> 3.Be  Gentle with it since it may be a fragile piece.
                  <br>Take your time with smootining the edges to get the best possible outcomes for aesthetic appeal.
                                       <br>Here is the final look to present to you:
                                       <br>Credits:Case and Mehemet

                    I aimed to use CNC in further projects it is very useful tool to accomplish great things from.

                <h3>Part 2:Moulding and Casting </h3>
                 <p>
                     Then for the second part of the Assignment I mouded and casted my hand.
                     <img width="100%" src="./t5.jpg" alt="e3">
                     Heres how I went onto do it .Fistly,I gathered the required materials 
                      <br>1.Algi safe. 7.5 oz
                      <br>2.Water.7.5 oz
                      <br>Mix the mixture well for over two minutes also stir it in a linear pattern that is to prevent any airbubblles from being created which is what happens when youdo it you norma clockwise or anticlockwise rotaion.Thanks Mehmet for reminding me .After we were done stirring it .It was time for me to dip my thumb in the mixture.
                       <br>You are supposed to keep your hand in for 12 to 15 minutes thanks Jessica for heping out with the details.
                      <br>Suprisingly keeping your hand in a solution can be real boring and tiresome but not when you have friends like Case who scroled reels for me for the  15 minyes taht went by in a blink of an eye .And before I knew it was time for me to get my hand off.
                      <br>Pro tip:Remove your hand once the mixture is hard that is you no longer fell the spongy self which it once was.What was eft of it wasnt a pleasant sight to my eyes .
                      <br>As seen here:
                        <img width="100%" src="./t6.jpg" alt="e3">
                    <br>Now we had to let it rest that is form its mould so that then we could remove it .So to 'ferment' we let it rest for about 35 hours which is longer than what you need to be out for.
                    And the outcome:
                    <br> <img src="./t7.jpg" alt="p1" width="300" height="400">
                    <br><h2>Voilla !!!</h2>
                    <br>A replicate of my hand which wasnt the best looking was honestly a great outcome than what I expected it to be .
                    <br>Pssst:Be careful while removing your mould because Mehemt gave me the scare of a life time by nearly dropping it while removing it .Just be a tiny bit careful to prevent anything from going wrong .Other wise all should be fine .Hopefully this was all for this week see you next time on the Internt  Assignment .Hoping this gets a ...

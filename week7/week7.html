                <h3>THE Mini Arcade game -MVP</h3>
                 
                 <p>
                    This week we were tasked with creating an MVP
                   <br>
                   When life gives you a literal slip (hope the knees are okay!), you create an arcade. That's not a backup plan‚Äîthat's engineering poetry.

Hidden win: Clothes-folding needs precision mechanics; your pivot took advantage of software creativity. Same grit, different muscles.

Instant joy: Ping pong isn‚Äôt just "simpler"‚Äîit‚Äôs a psychological hook. You validated faster by making users smile first.
<br> That "slip" (hope you‚Äôre okay!) became a catalyst for creativity. Switching to a ping-pong arcade game wasn‚Äôt "next best"‚Äîit was genius. Why?

Speed to launch: You built a playable prototype in 4 hours‚Äîa testament to focused execution.

Pure fun factor: Games make tech relatable. Your first idea (ping pong) resonated because it‚Äôs instant joy.
                    <br>The MVP is a minaturised version of your final project.At first I had decided to do a folding clothes prject but due to several dificulties and a slip (literally)I was unable to complete my project in time .There fore I decided to go ahead and do the next best thing create a mini arcade game for you to play ping pong with. This was the very first idea that I had presented and was happy with the way it turned out .

                    <h4>Mistakes not Make Again/Why not use Arduino UNO</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Slow</li>
                    <li>Does not have Wifi or Bluetooth</li>
                    <li>Will cause pain and misery for hours .</li>
                    
                </ul>
                    <br>Here is how I went on about with it :
                    <br>First I took an oled screen two buttons my trusted XIAO or ESP32C3 several pin to pin wires and began.I went through several tutorials on the curcuit diagram .Connecting the SCL and SDA were the most important as well as tiring part of my project .I got my project up and running in just 4 hours .The code was mighty exhaustive the insurmountable mountain I was unable to climb.
                    <img src="./p2.jpg" alt="p2" width="300" height="400"></br> 
                    <br>  Now came the one part which most of us I assume or atleast I struggle with that is the coding part .Therefor I did the hardwork so you can see the code.Here it is in its entirety:
                     <pre><code class="language-arduino">

    Serial.println(F("SSD1306 allocation failed"));
    while(1);
  }
  display.clearDisplay();
  display.display();
}

void loop() {
  display.clearDisplay();

  // 1. Move ball

  // 2. Ball collision with top/bottom
  if(ballY <= 0 || ballY >= SCREEN_HEIGHT-1) {
    ballSpeedY = -ballSpeedY;
  }

  if(ballX <= paddleWidth && abs(ballY - player1Y) < paddleHeight/2) {
    ballSpeedX = -ballSpeedX;
  }
  if(ballX >= SCREEN_WIDTH-paddleWidth-1 && abs(ballY - player2Y) < paddleHeight/2) {
    ballSpeedX = -ballSpeedX;
  }

  // 4. Reset ball if out of bounds
  if(ballX < 0 || ballX > SCREEN_WIDTH) {
    ballX = SCREEN_WIDTH/2;
    ballY = random(10, SCREEN_HEIGHT-10); // Random respawn
  }

  // 5. Button controls for paddles
  if(digitalRead(PLAYER1_UP_BUTTON) == LOW && player1Y > paddleHeight/2) {
    player1Y -= 2; // Move left paddle up
  }
  if(digitalRead(PLAYER1_DOWN_BUTTON) == LOW && player1Y < SCREEN_HEIGHT-paddleHeight/2) {
    player1Y += 2; // Move left paddle down
  }
  if(digitalRead(PLAYER2_UP_BUTTON) == LOW && player2Y > paddleHeight/2) {
    player2Y -= 2; // Move right paddle up
  }
  if(digitalRead(PLAYER2_DOWN_BUTTON) == LOW && player2Y < SCREEN_HEIGHT-paddleHeight/2) {
    player2Y += 2; // Move right paddle down
  }

  // 6. Draw everything
  display.drawRect(0, 0, SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT, SSD1306_WHITE); // Border
  display.fillRect(0, player1Y-paddleHeight/2, paddleWidth, paddleHeight, SSD1306_WHITE); // Left paddle

  display.display();

}

<br>But that wasnt the end of it .I had the great idea of experimenting with Arduino Uno .Which i learnt to be not so great of a chip compared to the XIAO .As Booby listed previously .But it did work as visible in the images listed above and video down here .
<br>‚è±Ô∏è Cycle Time: Each wave repeats every 380.1 nanoseconds (that‚Äôs billionths of a second!).

<br>üîÅ Stability: The signal is perfectly periodic (no drift or jitter)‚Äîit‚Äôs like a metronome for electronics.

<br>üìè Signal Size: Channel 1 () shows small swings of ~23.2 mV, typical for digital logic or precision circuits.

                <h3>Part 2: </h3>
                 <p>
                    This week, I explored electronic output devices‚Äîcomponents that respond to signals from a microcontroller to perform actions like displaying information, making sounds, or moving motors. My task was to choose an output device, pair it with a microcontroller, and program it to work.

With so many options‚Äîbuzzers, DC motors, servo motors, LEDs‚ÄîI decided to combine an input sensor (BME/BMP280) with an output display (Adafruit 1.14" TFT screen) to create a mini environment monitor.


                     Then for the second part of the Assignment I built a screen that displays the altitude temprature and humidity .
                     <br> Image of curcuit.
                     <img width="100%" src="./W1.png" alt="e3">
                     Heres how I went onto buid it .Fistly,I gathered the required materials 
                      <br>1.BMP 280
                      <br>2.TFT ISPLAY

                      <br>4.Others:The XIAO,Pin to Pin wires & a usb cable
                      These were the essentials .
                       <br>How did I begin you ask.
                      <br>THE PROCESS
                      <br>Setting everything up involved several key steps:

Hardware Connections

Carefully wired the BME280 sensor to the Arduino for data input.

Connected the TFT display to visualize the sensor readings.

Software Setup

Installed necessary libraries (Adafruit_ST7789, Adafruit_GFX, and Adafruit_BME280) to enable communication between the Arduino and the devices.

Wrote a program to read sensor data (temperature, humidity, pressure) and display it on the screen in real time.

Testing & Calibration

Verified sensor accuracy by comparing readings with known values (like room temperature).

Adjusted the display layout for better readability, ensuring text was clear and properly formatted
                    The code did take up some time but was doable.

                     <br> The Result: "Environment Watch"
The final setup acts like a mini weather station, showing:

Live temperature updates

Current humidity levels (thanks to the BME280)

Real-time air pressure readings

Seeing the numbers update dynamically on the screen was incredibly satisfying‚Äîit confirmed that the sensor and display were communicating perfectly 
                      
                 <img width="100%" src="./W2.png" alt="e3">
               <br>   Challenges & Lessons Learned
<br>Library Dependencies: Ensuring all libraries were correctly installed was crucial‚Äîmissing one meant the code wouldn‚Äôt run.

Wiring Precision: A loose connection once caused the display to malfunction, so double-checking all wires saved me debugging time.

Code Optimization: Initially, the display refresh rate was slow. Tweaking the code improved responsiveness.

<br>Future Improvements
<br>This project has so much potential! Next steps could include:

<br>Adding more sensors (like air quality or light sensors).

<br>Implementing data logging to track environmental changes over time.

<br>Designing a custom enclosure for a polished look.
<br>Working with the Oscilloscope
 <img width="100%" src="./W3.png" alt="e3">
One of the most interesting (and challenging) parts of this project was using an oscilloscope to analyze the signals from my BME280 sensor. Since I was new to oscilloscopes, it took some trial and error to get meaningful readings‚Äîbut it was a great learning experience!

<br>What I Observed
When I connected the sensor to the oscilloscope, I noticed:

<br>Continuous Data Streams: The BME280 constantly sends environmental data, creating a rapid, fluctuating waveform.

<br>Voltage Levels: The sensor communicates at 3.3V logic levels, which the oscilloscope had to be properly scaled to capture.

<br>Signal Noise: At first, the readings looked messy‚Äîlikely due to electrical interference or loose connections.

<br>Challenges & Fixes
Auto-Scaling Issues: The oscilloscope struggled to automatically adjust to the sensor's fast data rate. Switching to manual scaling helped stabilize the waveform.

<br>Triggering Problems: Setting the right trigger level was key‚Äîwithout it, the signal kept jumping around unpredictably.

<br>Grounding Matters: Ensuring a solid ground connection reduced noise and made the signal much clearer.
 <img width="100%" src="./W4.png" alt="e3">
<br>Why This Was Useful
Seeing the raw sensor signals helped me:
‚úî Verify the sensor was working correctly (no weird voltage drops or interruptions).
‚úî Understand data transmission timing (how often readings were being sent).
‚úî Debug potential wiring issues (like noise from poor connections).

<br>Final Thoughts
While oscilloscopes can seem intimidating at first, they‚Äôre incredibly powerful tools for troubleshooting electronics. Next time, I‚Äôd love to explore:

<br>Comparing signals from different sensors.

<br>Using protocol decoding (like SPI/I2C) to inspect the actual data packets.

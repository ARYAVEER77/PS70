                <h3>THE 3D MODEL: </h3>
                 
                 <p>
                    This week we were tasked with making a 3D model .It either coulld be made for fun or it was useful in your project .The previous night I had seen JAWS again with friends and decide to make a shark.But added a bit of my twist to it and made  a hammerhead shark.I have named it SIR BOOBY .For his continued dedication to answer my stupid queries .
                    Here is the link for the file:

                <h3>Part 2: </h3>
                 <p>
                     Then for the second part of the Assignment I used the Revo Point Scanner to scan my shoe.
                     Reminder to self:If itas too big to fit dont use it.
                     My shoe is a size 13.5 and the back of my shoe is shiny so it took me 8 scanns and 2 hours of continoius work to accomplish a scan that somewhat looks like a shoe .
                     Here it is:
